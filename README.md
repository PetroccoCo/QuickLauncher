Description
-----

Quick Launcher is a wrapper around Apple's 3D Touch API for home screen shortcuts.

Home screen shortcuts were introduced with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and provide users a way to quickly get into a workflow within an application.

This wrapper was created to ease the burden of checking for iOS 9 compatability in function calls and make it easer to receive and take actions on shortcuts. 
In addition to making it easer to read what shortcuts launched an application it provides a way to easily set and clear dynamic shortcuts for your app.

Check out the Example project for a full walkthrough of how to use the wrapper.
